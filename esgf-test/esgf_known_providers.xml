	ESGF OpenID Providers List for User Interface Combobox

	This list sets the entries in a combobox in the OpenID Relying
	Party user interface.  It allows users to pick an IdP from a list
	rather than having to type in their OpenID.

	*** IMPORTANT: Providers included MUST be running release 1.8
	or greater of ESGF in order to use the special generic
	identifier select OpenID URIs ***

	What is an OpenID Provider Identifier Select URI? - For ESGF Providers
	this consists of the usual OpenID URI minus the last element
	denoting the user identifier. e.g. for DKRZ's OpenID Provider,
	An example OpenID might be,

		https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/esgf-idp/openid/alice

	The equivalent identifier select URI is:

		https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/esgf-idp/openid/

	This represents a generic URI for the OpenID Provider.  This allows
	the ORP user interface to be simplified so that the user can select
	from one of a fixed set of options, one for each ESGF IdP.  Once
	selected, the user is redirected to their selected IdP and then asked
	to confirm their username along with their password.
